        """
        The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread globally, leading to significant health, economic, and social impacts.
        This unprecedented health crisis highlighted the crucial role of data analysis in managing such pandemics. By meticulously tracking and analyzing data on 
        confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, policymakers and health professionals can make informed decisions to control the spread of the virus and allocate 
        resources effectively.

    st.write("""
    This case study utilizes three key datasets, each providing daily updates on different aspects of the pandemic for various countries and regions:
    - **Confirmed Cases Dataset**: Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases per day from Jan 22, 2020 to May 29, 2021 across over 276 regions.
    - **Deaths Dataset**: Cumulative deaths attributed to COVID-19 over the same period and locations.
    - **Recovered Cases Dataset**: Cumulative recoveries to assess progression and treatment effectiveness.

    Each dataset includes:
    - Province/State
    - Country/Region
    - Geographic coordinates (Lat, Long)
    - Daily cumulative totals

    - **Practical Application of Python**: Enhance Python skills through real-world data tasks including cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
    - **Insightful Data Analysis**: Derive key insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 across time and geographies.
